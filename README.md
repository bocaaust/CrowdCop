# CrowdCop

Developed Fall 2015

A new spin on the way tips can be farmed for crime prevention and solving that uses crowd funding to make information more valuable for issues and crimes the public feels strongly about.

Founded at RPI as part of their center for open source development, this project is a socially adaptive way to protect your community. If you feel strongly about an issue, you can crowd fund it and as a result you can help prevent or solve that crime.
